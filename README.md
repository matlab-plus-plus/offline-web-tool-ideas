#### Ideas for Useful Web Tools
This is a listing of things that would make good web tools, useful for programming and other activities.
Most of these already exist as available tools on the open internet, but it would be nice to have these available in an offline air-gapped environment.
I believe every one of these tools could be coded as client-side apps which wouldn't require a server capable of executing code; just a static file server.

- GraphViz compiler and renderer [like this](https://www.devtoolsdaily.com/graphviz/)
- sqlite3 shell [like this wasm app](https://sqlite.org/fiddle/index.html) or a simple browser like [sqlime](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlime)
- SQL data description language (DDL) to diagram converter [like this](https://www.devtoolsdaily.com/sql/ddl-to-diagram/)
- reStructuredText/Sphinx live renderer
- regex tester like [regex101](https://regex101.com/) which has multiple regex flavors and allows you to add unit tests.
- NIST [Uncertainty Machine](https://uncertainty.nist.gov/)
- JSON/XML schema verifier
- LaTeX tables generator [like this](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/)
- [CLIPS](https://www.clipsrules.net/) wasm shell like the desktop app 
- An online editor/solver for Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL) like [this site](https://editor.planning.domains/)
- Online tools for the [SOAR cognitive architecture](https://soar.eecs.umich.edu/)
- An editor that could be used to markup plaintext files for code review.
Include syntax highlighting for different languages.
This could work like the Visual Studio Code [Code Review](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=d-koppenhagen.vscode-code-review) extension where you can highlight lines and add notes by priority/category and export all comments in .csv or .html.


Note that [devtoolsdaily](https://www.devtoolsdaily.com/) seems like a great resource containing multiple of these utilities.
